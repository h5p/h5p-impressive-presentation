Look for issues in the github repository.
If you find any issues check if anyone else is working on them and consider
collaborating with them.
If you cannot find your issues there, create it.
Fork master and create a pullrequest.

Known Issues that needs to be fixed:

Easy:

- [ ] Make zoom widget in overview prettier
- [ ] Make step configuration side panel prettier

Medium:

- [ ] Allow setting order of steps in previews side-panel
- [ ] Allow Include/exclude from path in previews side-panel
- [ ] Background widget: should uncheck transparency button when a background
    color or background image is chosen, should re-check if bg image is removed

Hard:

- [ ]  Improve free-transform rotations together with zoom so they make sense and
    are easily navigable
